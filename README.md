# Bank-Next-Best-Action-System-Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit

* Designed and developed a machine learning–driven banking recommendation system to predict the Next Best Product (NBP) for customers based on transactional and profile data.

* Built and trained a Random Forest classification model using integrated datasets (Fixed Deposits, Savings Accounts, Loans) to generate real-time product recommendations with probability scores.

* Implemented a purpose-aligned recommendation engine to dynamically adjust predictions based on customer intent (Loan, FD, Savings) while maintaining cross-sell logic.

* Developed an intelligent Action Plan module including product offers, bundled services, EMI simulation, and automated officer call scripts to support operational banking decisions.

* Integrated EMI calculation logic using financial formulas to simulate monthly repayments based on principal, interest rate, and tenure.

* Deployed the system as an interactive Streamlit web application with NIC-based customer validation (existing vs. new customer flow) and real-time prediction display.

* Implemented feature alignment logic to ensure consistent model input structure between training (Jupyter/Colab) and deployment environments.
